## Description

This project is a summary of this back-end trimester: authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing.

The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files:

* User authentication via a token
* List all files
* Upload a new file
* Change permission of a file
* View a file
* Generate thumbnails for images


Note: Of course, this kind of service already exists in the real life - itâ€™s a learning purpose to assemble each piece and build a full product. This platform will not feature a front-end interface the user can actually interact with. It is all handled strictly from the command line.
